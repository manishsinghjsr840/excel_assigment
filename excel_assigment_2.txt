For example, if you have a formula in cell A1 that refers to cell $A$1, and you copy the formula to cell B1, the formula in cell B1 will still refer to cell $A$1.

2. How to Change the Reference from Relative to Absolute (or Mixed)?

To change the reference from relative to absolute (or mixed), you can use the dollar sign ($) in front of the column letter or row number. For example, to make a cell reference absolute, you would use $A$1. To make a cell reference mixed, you would use $A1 or A$1.

3. Explain the order of operations in excel?

The order of operations in Excel is the order in which Excel evaluates mathematical expressions. The order of operations is as follows:

Parentheses
Exponents
Multiplication and division
Addition and subtraction
4. What, according to you, are the top 5 functions in excel and write a basic syntax for any of two?

The top 5 functions in Excel, in my opinion, are:

SUM: This function adds up the values in a range of cells.
AVERAGE: This function averages the values in a range of cells.
COUNT: This function counts the number of cells in a range that contain numbers.
MAX: This function returns the maximum value in a range of cells.
MIN: This function returns the minimum value in a range of cells.
Here is the basic syntax for the SUM function:

SUM(range)
Where range is the range of cells that you want to add up.

Here is the basic syntax for the AVERAGE function:

AVERAGE(range)
Where range is the range of cells that you want to average.

5. When would you use the subtotal function?

The SUBTOTAL function is used to calculate subtotals in a range of cells. For example, you could use the SUBTOTAL function to calculate the subtotals for each department in a sales report.

The syntax for the SUBTOTAL function is:

SUBTOTAL(function_num, range)
Where function_num is the number of the function that you want to use, and range is the range of cells that you want to calculate the subtotal for.

The most common function numbers for the SUBTOTAL function are:

1: SUM
2: AVERAGE
3: COUNT
4: MAX
5: MIN
6. What is the syntax of the vlookup function? Explain the terms in it?

The VLOOKUP function is used to look up values in a table. The syntax for the VLOOKUP function is:

VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, column_index_num, [range_lookup])
Where lookup_value is the value that you are looking for, table_array is the range of cells that contains the table, column_index_num is the column number of the value that you are looking for, and [range_lookup] is a Boolean value that specifies whether you want an exact match or an approximate match.

The terms in the VLOOKUP function are:

lookup_value: The value that you are looking for in the table.
table_array: The range of cells that contains the table.
column_index_num: The column number of the value that you are looking for.
[range_lookup]: A Boolean value that specifies whether you want an exact match or an approximate match.
